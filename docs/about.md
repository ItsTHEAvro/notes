# About This Site

## Purpose

Avro's Notes is my personal knowledge base where I document and share insights, learnings, and tutorials on various topics that interest me. My goal is to create a comprehensive resource that is both helpful to others and serves as my own external memory system.

## About Me

Avro here! I'm a CSE student who's all about tech. I love to build, break, and make it better. I have hands-on experience in ML, dev, automation, and cybersecurity. My thing is using tech to solve and secure real-world stuff. You'll often catch me exploring web security, reverse engineering, or battling it out in CTFs. When I'm not coding, I'm chilling with my sketchbook or my guitar.
